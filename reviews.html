       <h2 class="dish_name">Sirniki</h2> 
    <img src="sirniki.jpg" alt="Sirniki" class="dish_image"> <p class="dish_text"> Cottage cheese pancakes perfect when served hot off the pan with sour cream and jam for breakfast. <br> Sirniki are often described as cheese pancakes, which, to my mind, gives a false impression of them being doughy. And they are most certainly not. Sirniki might resemble pancakes in shape, but taste a lot more like a warm cheesecake than an actual pancake.</p>

    <h2 class="dish_name">Borscht</h2> 
        <img src="Borsch.png" alt="Borsch"  class="dish_image">
        <p class="dish_text"> Borscht is a beet soup that's warm, sweet, and sour all in one bowl. It has the umami and complexity of a well-developed chicken soup but the beets add a whole different flavor profile. <br>
      Its sweetness comes from the beets, onions, and cabbage, and its tartness from tomatoes and vinegar. Some meat can be added for richness. For a better borscht experience, many people enjoy adding sour cream, yogurt, or fresh herbs. It's warm, sweet, full of umami, and sour all in one bowl. <br> Warm and perfect for winter!</p>
