       <h2 class="dish_name">Sirniki</h2> 
    <img src="sirniki.png" alt="Sirniki" class="dish_image"> <p class="dish_text"> Sirniki are often described as cheese pancakes, which, to my mind, gives a false impression of them being doughy, and they are most certainly not. Sirniki might resemble pancakes in shape, but taste a lot more like a warm cheesecake than an actual pancake. <br> They are perfect when served hot off the pan with sour cream and jam for breakfast. </p>

    <h2 class="dish_name">Borscht</h2> 
        <img src="Borsch.png" alt="Borsch"  class="dish_image">
        <p class="dish_text"> Borscht is a beet soup that's warm, sweet, and sour all in one bowl. It has the umami and complexity of a well-developed chicken soup but the beets add a whole different flavor profile. <br>
      Its sweetness comes from the beets, onions, and cabbage, and its tartness from tomatoes and vinegar. Some meat can be added for richness. For a better borscht experience, many people enjoy adding sour cream, yogurt, or fresh herbs. <br> It's warm, sweet, full of umami, and sour all in one bowl. Perfect for winter!</p>

        <img src="Kulaga.jpg" alt="Kulaga"  class="dish_image">
        <p class="dish_text"> Kulaga is an almost forgotten, but very tasty and healthy Belarusian dish. It's a jam-like dessert made from berries, honey, and wheat flour â€” excellent and simple. Kulaga is tasty, healthy, and can help soothing a cold.</p>
